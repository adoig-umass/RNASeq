In order to open a shiny server and begin an application to interpret
the shiny app, you will need to use conda to open an environment
containing the shiny server tool, and then load in the app you are
trying to view on the browser. This is done by using the conda tool.
For example, in order to view the shiny output from the differential 
abundance tool from nextflow, you should enter

(if you do not already have a conda environment for running the shiny
ngs tools)

conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda create -n shinyngs r-shinyngs


To open up this particular environment, enter the following

conda activate shinyngs,

Now you can navigate to the directory where the shiny NGS toolset is,
and using the following commands open up a shiny server hosting the
page to browse your data.

To do this, from within the (shinyngs) environemnt, you can use the script
that was generateda along with the differential abundance to launch the
server. You can do this by entering "app.R".

And then at the end of the command, after the output string that was used
to boot the software, the computer will be listening on a particular
http://location. You can enter this into a web browser or control click the
addresss and it will open up in a browser.
